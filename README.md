# 🌦️ JetWeather

 JetWeather is a Native Android Application that provides real-time weather data and a 5-day forecast. The app is built using modern Android development tools and libraries, including Jetpack Compose for the UI, Compose Navigation, Hilt for dependency injection, and Room for local data storage. The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern and uses StateFlow and Flow for managing and updating UI states efficiently.
